# Kare Experiments Repository

This repository holds the experiment log, a to do list, individual experiment documents, relevant input data, results and experiment codes for reproducibility purposes.

Each individual experiment is assigned a 7 character unique id of the format `AAA1234`. The first three characters are letters and correspond to the relevant portfolio generating function. The last 4 characters are numbers and are assigned randomly and differ for varying parameters of the portfolio generating function thus create a unique experiment. 

## The Experiment Log

The experiment log is the main document to navigate through the experiments conducted during this study and contains an entry for each portfolio generating function. Each entry has the following format:



- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
