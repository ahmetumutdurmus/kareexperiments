# Kare Experiments Repository
This repository holds the experiment log, a to do list, individual experiment documents, relevant input data, results and experiment codes for reproducibility purposes.

Each individual experiment is assigned a 7 character unique id of the format `AAA1234`. The first three characters are letters and correspond to the relevant portfolio generating function. The last 4 characters are numbers and are assigned randomly and differ for varying parameters of the portfolio generating function thus create a unique experiment.
