# Cumulative Ranking Explicit Churn (CRE6168)

This experiment runs a grid search for [cumulative ranking explicit churn function](https://github.com/ahmetumutdurmus/kareexperiments/blob/master/docs/src/The%20Experiment%20Log.md#cumulative-ranking-explicit-churn-cre)
through time as explained in the relevant documentation. 

The objective of this experiment was to determine whether PCA reconstruction effect was significant during the mean reversion phase. 
In order to do this the PCA spread was replaced by vanilla mean reversion. This is equivalent with setting `o[:featurenum]`
