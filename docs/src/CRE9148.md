[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Date%20of%20Experiment-07%2F12%2F2018-blue.svg "Date of Experiment")](https://github.com/ahmetumutdurmus/kareexperiments/blob/master/docs/src/CRE9148.md)

This experiment runs a grid search for [cumulative ranking explicit churn function](https://github.com/ahmetumutdurmus/kareexperiments/blob/master/docs/src/The%20Experiment%20Log.md#cumulative-ranking-explicit-churn-cre) through time as explained in the relevant documentation. 

The objective of this experiment was to determine which element of the cartesian product of `o[:pcatype]` and `o[:normtype]` gave the best results for different `o[:lambda]` and `o[:churn]` values. 

In short the best results were obtained by using `covariance` and `mean normalization`. The full results are presented below. 

The relevant varying and constant hyperparameters are as follows:

## Varying Parameters:

```julia
o[:pcatype] = {:cov, :cor}
    Type of similarity used during PCA.
o[:normtype] = {0, 1, 2} 
    Type of normalization procedure used on raw data before PCA. `0` denotes no normalization. 
    `1` denotes subtracting the mean. `2` denotes z-score normalization. 
o[:lambda] = {exp(log(0.1):log(100)/50:log(10))}
    The constant before PE rankings to enforce the relative weights of PCA spread and PE rankings. 
    Note that the constant before PCA spread rankings is 1. 
o[:churn] = {0.10:0.01:0.20}
    The daily churn constraint of the portfolio generating function.
```

## Constant Parameters:

```julia
o[:retrospectionperiod] = Month(6) 
    The length of retrospection period of return series to be used while doing PCA.
o[:PCAdays] = 4 
    The number of days to compound when obtaining the spread between PCA reconstruction and market returns.
o[:rankmode] = :Collective 
    The ranking statistic to use when optimizing. `:Collective` denotes the statistic obtained by using both PE
    and spread. `:PEranks` and `:Spreadranks` are self explanatory.
o[:addsecurities] = false 
    The decision whether to add the returns of the nontradable indices to the PCA analysis. If true, the 
    nontradable indices are included in the PCA reconstruction process but are disregarded during trading.
o[:featurenum] = 1 
    The number of eigenvectors to be used when conducting the PCA.  
o[:initialstart] = Date(2013, 1, 2)
    The first date of backtesting.
o[:endofperiod] = o[:initialstart]
    The current day holder for portfolio generation function. 
```
